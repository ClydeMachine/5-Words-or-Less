# Summary

Five Words or Less is proposed as a verbal protocol whereby conversations can be made more time efficient by communicating an idea much more quickly than conventional methods.

This protocol is intended to be used as a verbal protocol during casual conversation to head-off what would otherwise turn into a lengthy but less-than informative venture for the receiving party. It is implemented when the receiver of the information anticipates a long explanation from the speaker regarding a situation, idea, story, recounting of a movie or book, or any other such situation. The receiver prompts the speaker with some semblance of the phrase "Explain it in five words or less" and the speaker then obliges and crafts a sentence consisting of no more than five words to give a simplified overview of the story to follow.

In a trivial sense, the receiver can use the protocol to gauge if they would be interested in the plot of a TV show or screenplay without having to hear the details of individual characters, setting, etc.

# Motivation

The intention of this protocol is to provide a simple framework for improving the efficiency of delivering information in casual conversation. Valuable time can be saved by reducing the number of words committed to an idea. If you can communicate the idea in five words or less, you save a great deal of time by not taking five hundred.

# Detailed design

In casual conversation, when you as a receiver anticipate a lengthy explanation or drawn-out story, or if you think the speaker may be going over the same ground, you prompt them with a variant of "Can you explain it in five words or less?" The following scenario details an appropriate application of the protocol:

```
Speaker: This guy that I'm helping on his server problem is being incredibly difficult.
Receiver: Actually, I think you told me about this once before. Can you explain it in five words or less?
Speaker: ...'Guy didn't read his logs.'
Receiver: Yeah, we talked about this guy before.
Speaker: Okay, so I won't go over the whole history. So, now the issue is...
```

```
Speaker: There's this book I've been reading that you might like.
Receiver: Don't think I've heard of it - what's it about, in five words or less?
Speaker: ...'Teenage love story with vampires.'
Receiver: Ah. Well, vampires aren't my thing.
```

# Drawbacks

The limitation of five words occasionally affords the speaker too little room to craft a meaningful sentence, reducing their efforts to an incomplete string of words, akin to keywords or search tags. However, this can often still convey the idea in a suitable manner and still achieve the goal of time efficiency. 

The limitation can also prove to omit key details of an idea, and as such the protocol cannot always be applied. Its true strength is seen when having to hear the recounting of a movie or a book that one does not wish to dive into themselves, and simply want to know if they would be interested in the subject matter.

# Alternatives

The current alternative to this method is to interrupt someone when delivering a lengthy explanation, or to endure the onslaught of words. The latter may be perceived as more polite, but is far less efficient and maybe a little less honest than the Five Words or Less method.

# Unresolved questions

None.
